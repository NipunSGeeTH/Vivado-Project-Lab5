<h1>Vivado Project - Lab 5</h1>
    <p>
        Multiplication is a fundamental arithmetic operation. Addition and multiplication arithmetic are used in 
        computer systems, digital signal processing, image processing, and embedded systems.

        This lab exercise is to implement logic circuits for binary multiplication. It can get help from the Full Adder (FA) circuits we 
        designed in Lab 3. Specifically, two types of multipliers are developed here:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>2-bit multiplier</strong> – multiplication of two 2-bit binary numbers – 4-bit output</li>
        <li><strong>4-bit multiplier</strong> – multiplication of two 4-bit binary numbers – 8-bit output</li>
    </ul>
